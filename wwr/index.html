            <p>Hello! My name is Ukeje Frank Chika, and I am currently enrolled in the Web Design
                and Development
                program. I have a deep interest in creating visually appealing, responsive, and
                user-friendly
                websites that combine clean design with strong functionality. I enjoy turning ideas
                into
                well-structured digital experiences and paying close attention to layout,
                accessibility, and
                usability to ensure users have a smooth and engaging interaction with websites.

                Beyond my coursework, I actively spend time exploring new web technologies, tools,
                and frameworks to
                expand my knowledge and stay current with industry trends. I enjoy learning about
                modern design
                principles, front-end development techniques, and best practices for writing clean,
                efficient code.
                Working on personal projects allows me to experiment, solve problems, and
                continuously sharpen my
                skills.

                I am highly motivated, detail-oriented, and eager to grow as a web developer. I
                enjoy collaborating
                with others, learning from feedback, and taking on new challenges that push me
                outside my comfort
                zone. My goal is to build meaningful, well-designed web solutions while continuously
                improving my
                technical abilities and preparing for a successful career in web design and
                development.</p>

            <p>Nigeria is a country in West Africa known for its large population,
